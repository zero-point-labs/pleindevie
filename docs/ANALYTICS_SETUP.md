# Website Analytics Setup Guide

## Overview

This landing page now features a **comprehensive analytics dashboard** focused on **demographics, user behavior, sessions, and website performance** rather than just lead tracking. The system provides insights similar to professional analytics platforms.

- **Real-time Performance** - Hourly patterns, page performance metrics

### ✅ Issues Fixed
- **Removed excessive API polling** - No more constant `GET /api/analytics` requests every 30 seconds

- **Low pages per session** (<2) = Improve internal linking and content flow
- **Mobile dominance** = Prioritize mobile-first design
- **Geographic concentration** = Consider localized content

### For Business Growth
