    "zod": "^3.22.4",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1"
  }
}
```
5. Create basic folder structure for components, hooks, utils, and pages
6. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
7. Set up basic routing structure
8. Implement global styling with brand colors (#D4AF37 gold, #1A2B4C navy)
9. Create typography and design token system

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and configured
2. Test build process to ensure it completes without errors
3. Validate TypeScript configuration
4. Check that Tailwind CSS is properly configured with custom theme
5. Ensure shadcn/ui components render correctly
6. Test responsive grid system across different viewport sizes
