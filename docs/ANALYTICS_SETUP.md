# Analytics Setup Guide

## Overview

This project now features a **comprehensive analytics dashboard** focused on demographics, user behavior, sessions, and website performance. The system intelligently combines Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for rich demographic data with a lightweight custom analytics system for immediate website feedback.

## üöÄ Quick Setup: Enable Google Analytics 4

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Basic GA4 tracking (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Advanced: GA4 Data API for real analytics in admin dashboard (optional)
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}
```

### 2. Get Your GA4 Measurement ID

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Create a new GA4 property
3. Copy your **Measurement ID** (starts with `G-`)
4. Add it to your environment variables

### 3. Optional: Enable Real Analytics Data (Advanced)

For **real demographics, sessions, and user behavior data** in your admin dashboard:

#### Step 1: Enable Google Analytics Data API

   - **Roles:** Select **"Viewer"** (this gives read-only access)
   - **Notify new users via email:** Uncheck this (service accounts don't need emails)
   - Click **"Add"**

#### Step 6: Set Environment Variables

1. **Open the JSON file** you downloaded in a text editor
2. **Copy the entire JSON content** (it starts with `{"type":"service_account"...`)
3. **Add to your `.env.local` file:**

```bash
# Your existing GA4 ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-S8HC4LNC73

# New variables for real analytics data
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"abc123",...}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Put the entire JSON on one line for `GA4_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
- Don't add quotes around the JSON (it's already a string)
- The Property ID is just the number, no quotes needed

#### Step 7: Test Your Setup

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check the console logs:**
   - Visit your admin dashboard
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for: `"‚úÖ Using real GA4 data for analytics dashboard"`

3. **If you see errors:**
   - Check that the Property ID is correct (just numbers)
   - Verify the service account email was added to GA4
   - Make sure the JSON key is on one line in your `.env.local`

## üìä Dashboard Sections

- **Total Visitors**: Unique users visiting your site
- **Page Views**: Total page impressions
- **Avg. Session**: Pages viewed per session
- **Conversion Rate**: Visitors who became leads

### User Demographics & Behavior
- **Traffic Sources**: How users find your site (direct, organic, social, referral)

- **Geographic insights** (countries, cities)
- **Browser and device analytics**
- **Traffic source analysis**

## üîß Analytics Architecture

### GA4 (Primary) - Demographics & Behavior
- **Purpose**: Rich demographic and behavioral insights
- **Data**: User locations, devices, browsers, session patterns
- **When**: Real-time tracking with aggregated reporting
- **Privacy**: GDPR compliant, follows Google's data policies

### Custom Analytics (Supplementary) - Website Performance
- **Purpose**: Immediate website performance feedback
- **Data**: Page views, basic user interactions, lead generation
- **When**: Instant feedback for admin dashboard
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection, no personal information

## üìà Analytics Events Tracked

### Website Performance Events
- Page views and navigation
- Session duration and engagement
- Basic user flow patterns

### User Behavior Events (GA4)
- Geographic location (country/city)
- Device type and browser usage
- Traffic source identification
- Session depth and return visits

### Minimal Lead Events
- Lead form views and submissions
- Project type preferences
- Budget range selections

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Analytics sections stuck on loading"
**Cause**: GA4 not configured or insufficient data
**Solution**: 
1. Check if `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is set
2. For real data, configure GA4 Data API (see setup above)
3. Visit your site a few times to generate data

### "Custom vs GA4 confusion"
**Current behavior**: 
- ‚úÖ GA4 configured: Uses real Google Analytics data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GA4 not configured: Falls back to demo data for dashboard
- üîÑ Data source is indicated in console logs

### "No data showing in dashboard"
**Solutions**:
1. **For frontend tracking**: Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` to environment
2. **For admin dashboard**: Configure GA4 Data API credentials
3. **For demo data**: System automatically provides sample data when GA4 is unavailable

### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct format
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# ‚ùå Common mistakes
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"  # Remove quotes
GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX               # Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
```

## üìö Key Improvements Made

### Analytics Focus Shift
- ‚úÖ **From**: Lead-heavy, sales-focused metrics
- ‚úÖ **To**: Demographics, user behavior, and website performance

### Issues Fixed
- ‚úÖ Removed excessive API polling (was every 30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Added manual "Refresh Data" button for better control
- ‚úÖ Fixed type errors and production build issues
- ‚úÖ Reduced server load with conditional API calls

### System Optimizations
- ‚úÖ Prioritizes GA4 over custom analytics
- ‚úÖ Falls back gracefully when GA4 is unavailable
- ‚úÖ Provides demo data to prevent loading states
- ‚úÖ Optimized for production deployment

## üìã Best Practices

1. **Start with basic GA4**: Just add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`
2. **Monitor console logs**: Check which data source is being used
3. **Use manual refresh**: Click "Refresh Data" to update dashboard
4. **Configure GA4 Data API gradually**: For advanced features when needed
5. **Respect user privacy**: All tracking follows GDPR guidelines

## üîÑ Migration from Lead-Heavy Analytics

### Benefits of New System
- **Better user insights**: Understand visitor behavior, not just conversions
- **Improved performance**: Reduced API calls and server load
- **Real demographic data**: Actual geographic and device information
- **Scalable architecture**: Designed for growth and expansion

### What Changed
- Dashboard now focuses on user behavior and demographics
- Lead tracking is minimal and privacy-focused
- Real-time data comes from Google Analytics
- Custom analytics provides immediate feedback only
